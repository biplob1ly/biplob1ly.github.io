title: How Did I Do This?

Hi there!
In case you are wondering how to make a github page like this, it's relatively easy! Just introduce yourself with [Lanyon](https://lanyon.getpoole.com/) which is a Jekyll theme. You can also modify it according to [this](http://patricksteadman.ca/2014/08/04/lanyonsetup/) and [that](https://www.nikhita.dev/build-blog-using-github-jekyll) post. A little understanding of markdown and github pages should be sufficient to accomplish all these.

Hope this helps, Thanks!
