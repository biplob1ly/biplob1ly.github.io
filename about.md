Hey there! I am a second year Ph.D. student at the [Ohio State University (OSU)](https://www.osu.edu/). My research focuses on application of machine learning in bioinformatics. Currently, I am investigating existing neural network models to predict drug-target interaction.

Before joining OSU, I obtained my B.Sc. in CSE from [Bangladesh Universiy of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/). I also worked at [Kona Software Lab Ltd](https://konasl.com/) at Dhaka site for 2 years.
