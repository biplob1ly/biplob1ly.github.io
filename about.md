---

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://cse.osu.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Rajiv Ramnath](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~ramnath.6/). My research focuses on the application of in the application of machine learning, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I have experience in employing neural information retrieval (IR) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to develop retrieval-guided response generation (NLG) models for conversational agents. 

Before joining OSU, I obtained my B.Sc. in CSE from [Bangladesh Universiy of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/). I also worked at [Kona Software Lab Ltd](https://konasl.com/) at the Dhaka site for 2 years.
