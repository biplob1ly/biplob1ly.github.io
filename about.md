title: About Me
---

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering, The Ohio State University (OSU)](https://cse.osu.edu/) supervised by Prof. [Rajiv Ramnath](https://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~ramnath.6/). My research focuses on the application of in the application of machine learning, especially in Natural Language Processing (NLP). I have experience in employing neural information retrieval (IR) and reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to develop retrieval-guided response generation (NLG) models for conversational agents. 

Before joining OSU, I obtained my B.Sc. in CSE from [Bangladesh Universiy of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/). I also worked at [Kona Software Lab Ltd](https://konasl.com/) at the Dhaka site for 2 years.

Internship
--------

- Designed, developed and deployed a knowledge-grounded response generation system to automatically answer to customer queries in a customer care setting. The system utilizes neural information retrieval (IR) techniques to collect knowledge from historical unstructured data and blends that information into generated response through a fine-tuned GPT-2 model. It also includes a novel ranking mechanism for better response selection from multiple generations. The system is deployed as an API service. Technology Used: _AWS, Docker, Python, PyTorch_.

- Developed a paraphrasing model and corresponding web service to introduce diversity in the business response template. Technology Used: _AWS, Docker, Python, Python_

Projects
--------

- Designed and developed a deep-learning model - [TransICD](https://github.com/biplob1ly/TransICD) to predict ICD codes from a patient discharge summary. The model achieves a micro-AUC score of 0.923 beating several strong baselines. Technology Used: _Python, PyTorch_
